// Reverse linked list in alternate groups of k.
// I created a function of reversing the linked list. I then traversed the
// linked list and created a loop till k and reversed the list and also kept a
// bool value for checking whether it was the first k nodes and for that saved
// the head and then for next k nodes made no changes and so on till NULL and
// returned head.
